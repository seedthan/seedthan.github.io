So often when working in restoration ecology there's the question of "restoring to what?" to that I say... restoring resiliency to our systems!

This is the framework I use when approaching restoration work... I think I'll be using this page as a sort of brain dump for developing that framework figuring out what it means to restore resiliency.  Words are great, but better when we ascribe meaning to them!

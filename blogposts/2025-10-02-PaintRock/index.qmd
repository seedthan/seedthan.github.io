Roll tide!!!!! This past weekend, September 26th to 28th, myself (Ethan)
and Meghan embarked on a trip down to Paint Rock Forest, \~20 miles
southeast of Hunstville, AL, for some field work! I was scouting for
some more tupelo for my research, and Meghan came along to help out and
also check out one of the newest ForestGEO sites, Paint Rock Forest!

Having never navigated karst topography before, and having never been to
Alabama, I was in for some new experiences. The forest there was
probably the healthiest forest I have ever been in. So much species
diversity! The native Euonymus! The native Callicarpa! Flowering
orchids! Wowowowowow!!!!

We had the absolute pleasure of being helped out and shown around by
Helen and Patience, both field workers at Paint Rock and who know the
site like the back of their hands. It's so amazing to hear about and
walk around a site from those who are so passionate about it. I learned
lots about the natural environment in Paint Rock as well as the various
research projects going on there (cave ecology!!!!). Also, Helen took us
around on the UTV which saved us a lottttt of bushwhacking and
scrambling!

Our fieldwork was pretty successful, with many a tupelo found, though
notably looking a bit less healthy compared to their northern
counterparts. This could be because we're pushing the southern end of
their range here, and they are moving northward, but it was an
interesting observation nonetheless.

Now, on to fruit cleaning!

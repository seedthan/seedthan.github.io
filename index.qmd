Heyo! I'm Ethan Skuches (pronounced like... crutches...). Professionally, I am broadly interested in how humans can best prepare forests (and ecosystems at large) for shifts in climate, and how this preparation coincides with public education and the commercial marketing/ supply of native plants.

Within this, I'm really interested in how any type of planting project (restoration, urban street trees, yards, etc.) can be used as a conduit for forest assisted migration. I'm currently pursuing my PhD in Environmental Science at the University of Virginia, working with Dr. Meghan Blumstein and [the BUDS Lab](https://uva.theopenscholar.com/budslab)!

Outside of research, I tend to romp around and fill my time with a myriad of things: knitting, reading, swimming, hiking, looking at plants, and losing at trivia, to name a few.

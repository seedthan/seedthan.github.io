Heyo! My name is Ethan Skuches (pronounced like... crutches...). I'm a forest ecologist, avid knitter, and reader, amongst other things. Professionally, I am broadly interested in how humans can best prepare forests for shifts in climate, and how this preparation coincides with public education and the commercial marketing/ supply of native plants. Outside of research, I tend to be romping around filling my time with a myriad of things (knitting, reading, swimmming, hiking, looking at plants, etc).

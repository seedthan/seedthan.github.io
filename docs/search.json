    "section": "",
    "text": "Writing from the Hudson Valley up in New York! I’ve been here for a few days doing some fieldwork up at Mohonk Preserve in Gardiner, New York. My fieldwork is consisting largely of scouting for tupelo (Nyssa sylvatica) throughout the Preserve, looking for upland dry and lowland wet populations.\nThe fieldwork has been gorgeous and awesome- about 6 miles of bushwhacking through chestnut oak-hemlock forests, rhododendron groves (swaths, walls), and along babbling brooks and streams! All around, there have been tupelo! Not necessarily in swaths, but they’re standing tall (literally) among these different forest types.\nWe were able to find the upland dry trees fairly easily, fruiting and all, where I took cores and about 50 fruits from 5 different trees in these dry sites. The tupelo up in Mohonk are huge… talking ~30 meters tall and reaching upwards of 60cm in DBH!! While the dry trees were fairly easy to find, the wet individuals were much more challenging. Not necessarily to find tupelo, or to find large tupelo, but specifically to find fruit-bearing tupelo.\nTupelo are polygamodioecious, which is a complex reproductive strategy meaning that some individuals produce bisexual flowers, while other individuals may produce unisexual flowers. This essentially helps them in the absence of other tupelos to be able to be pollinated and spread, should they wish.\nInterestingly, when looking for the trees in a more wet environment, we struggled to locate trees with fruit. There are some theories that individuals will become fruit bearing in response to stress, and being proximal to a higher water table would reduce stress, therefore perhaps there’s less fruit for that reason… but I’m not sure. Either way, it was much more difficult to find wet and fruiting individuals. In the end though… we succeeded! All along the Coxing Kill at Mohonk.\nNow the samples come back with me to Charlottesville for processing analysis, and the fruit for germination!\nSuper special thank you to Evan from Mohonk Preserve for helping me navigate the Preserve, and Keri VanCamp and Kaylin Engerman from Vassar (old co-workers, current friends) for coming out to help me with some of my graduate work!"

    "text": "Roll tide!!!!! This past weekend, September 26th to 28th, myself (Ethan) and Meghan embarked on a trip down to Paint Rock Forest, ~20 miles southeast of Hunstville, AL, for some field work! I was scouting for some more tupelo for my research, and Meghan came along to help out and also check out one of the newest ForestGEO sites, Paint Rock Forest!\nHaving never navigated karst topography before, and having never been to Alabama, I was in for some new experiences. The forest there was probably the healthiest forest I have ever been in. So much species diversity! The native Euonymus! The native Callicarpa! Flowering orchids! Wowowowowow!!!!\nWe had the absolute pleasure of being helped out and shown around by Helen and Patience, both field workers at Paint Rock and who know the site like the back of their hands. It’s so amazing to hear about and walk around a site from those who are so passionate about it. I learned lots about the natural environment in Paint Rock as well as the various research projects going on there (cave ecology!!!!). Also, Helen took us around on the UTV which saved us a lottttt of bushwhacking and scrambling!\nOur fieldwork was pretty successful, with many a tupelo found, though notably looking a bit less healthy compared to their northern counterparts. This could be because we’re pushing the southern end of their range here, and they are moving northward, but it was an interesting observation nonetheless.\nNow, on to fruit cleaning!\nResearch aside, here’s a list of cool things we saw/ did:\n\nWent around on a UTV\nSaw a southern devil scorpion (Vaejovis carolinianus)\nCaves!!! so many caves!!! We went in a cave!!!\nSinkholes (?!)\nSuper cool rocks\nCoral fossils!\nNoteworthy plants:\n\ncrane fly orchid\nresurrection fern\nTrillium sp.\noval ladies’ tresses\nnarrow leaved glade fern\nstrawberry bush\nAmerican beauty bush\ntall bellflower\nEastern leatherwood\nred mulberry\nriver cane\nleafcup\nsweetgum\nsourwood\ncherrybark oak\nwater oak\npersimmon\nMaryland senna\nswamp tupelo\nCarolina buckthorn\n\n\nPhotos for your viewing pleasure:"

    "text": "current projects:\n\nPopulation Differentiation & Adaptive Significance of Nyssa sylvatica (advised by Meghan Blumstein)\nNyssa sylvatica, commonly known as blackgum, is a facultative, deciduous tree species present in a variety of ecological communities in eastern temperate forests. Facultative species have an equal probability of occurring in wetland and non-wetland environments; examples include sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua) and red maple (Acer rubrum). In forest environments, blackgum can be found anywhere from dry upland forests to saturated soils and riverbanks. Blackgum are commonly used as street trees and decorative plantings in urban and suburban settings due to their attractive fall foliage and tolerance to urban environmental conditions including road salts, heat, and pollution. Blackgum can be found in a remarkable variety of environments, but what enables this? Is this broad range of tolerances a product of plasticity, or has blackgum genetically adapted to these various microclimates?\nTrees can generate thousands of genetically diverse offspring each year; if one happens to fall in the right microsite (e.g. light, soil, moisture), it will germinate and potentially live on for hundreds to thousands of years. This research aims to understand the degree to which microenvironmental variation creates and maintains genetic differentiation in tree species within populations. Using blackgum as a proxy for other facultative tree species, this research investigates the adaptive capacity of N. sylvatica to respond to rapid environmental change.\nFurthermore, how does this genetic differentiation influence how we should be moving plants across landscapes? Perhaps blackgum growing in wet environments are genetically predisposed to have higher tolerances to environmental instability. If this is the case, should we prioritize moving those more resilient genotypes?\n\nIn collaboration with:\n\nPaint Rock Forest Research Center (Trenton, AL)\nMohonk Preserve (Gardiner, NY)\nBlandy Experimental Farm (Boyce, VA)\nVassar College (Poughkeepsie, NY)\nCentral Arkansas University (Little Rock, AR)\n\n\nMorven Sustainability Lab Land Management\n\nPhenology Trail & Local Phenology Program (est. 2026)\nFlora Development & Database Management\nInvasive Species Management & Monitoring\n\nRed Oak Climate Adaptation Lab"

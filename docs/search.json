    "title": "Tupelo Scouting @ Mohonk Preserve",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Writing from the Hudson Valley up in New York! I’ve been here for a few days doing some fieldwork up at Mohonk Preserve in Gardiner, New York. My fieldwork is consisting largely of scouting for tupelo (Nyssa sylvatica) throughout the Preserve, looking for upland dry and lowland wet populations.\nThe fieldwork has been gorgeous and awesome- about 6 miles of bushwhacking through chestnut oak-hemlock forests, rhododendron groves (swaths, walls), and along babbling brooks and streams! All around, there have been tupelo! Not necessarily in swaths, but they’re standing tall (literally) among these different forest types.\nWe were able to find the upland dry trees fairly easily, fruiting and all, where I took cores and about 50 fruits from 5 different trees in these dry sites. The tupelo up in Mohonk are huge… talking ~30 meters tall and reaching upwards of 60cm in DBH!! While the dry trees were fairly easy to find, the wet individuals were much more challenging. Not necessarily to find tupelo, or to find large tupelo, but specifically to find fruit-bearing tupelo.\nTupelo are polygamodioecious, which is a complex reproductive strategy meaning that some individuals produce bisexual flowers, while other individuals may produce unisexual flowers. This essentially helps them in the absence of other tupelos to be able to be pollinated and spread, should they wish.\nInterestingly, when looking for the trees in a more wet environment, we struggled to locate trees with fruit. There are some theories that individuals will become fruit bearing in response to stress, and being proximal to a higher water table would reduce stress, therefore perhaps there’s less fruit for that reason… but I’m not sure. Either way, it was much more difficult to find wet and fruiting individuals. In the end though… we succeeded! All along the Coxing Kill at Mohonk.\nNow the samples come back with me to Charlottesville for processing analysis, and the fruit for germination!\nSuper special thank you to Evan from Mohonk Preserve for helping me navigate the Preserve, and Keri VanCamp and Kaylin Engerman from Vassar (old co-workers, current friends) for coming out to help me with some of my graduate work!"

    "text": "Heyo! I’m Ethan Skuches (pronounced like… crutches…). Professionally, I am broadly interested in how humans can best prepare forests (and ecosystems at large) for shifts in climate, and how this preparation coincides with public education and the commercial marketing/ supply of native plants.\nWithin this, I’m really interested in how any type of planting project (restoration, urban street trees, yards, etc.) can be used as a conduit for forest assisted migration. I’m currently pursuing my PhD in Environmental Science at the University of Virginia, working with Dr. Meghan Blumstein and the BUDS Lab!\nOutside of research, I tend to romp around and fill my time with a myriad of things: knitting, reading, swimming, hiking, looking at plants, and losing at trivia, to name a few.\n\nEducationOutreach & Volunteer WorkTeaching\n\n\nPhD Student in Environmental Science, Ecology | University of Virginia | Charlottesville, Virginia | June 2025- Present\nB.A. in Environmental Studies | Vassar College | Poughkeepsie, New York | Grad. 2022\n\n\nGraduate Representative | University of Virginia Landscape & Arboretum Committee | Dec. 2025 - Present\nGraduate Student Mentor | University of Virginia Environmental Science Department | September 2025- Present\nSteering Committee Member | Mid-Atlantic Seed Partnership, Northeast Seed Network | June 2025- Present\nMember | Municipal Tree Advisory Committee | Beacon, New York | 2023 - 2025\nMember | Vassar College Arboretum Committee | 2023-2025\nMember | Vassar College Preserve Advisory Committee | 2023-2025\n\n\nUniversity of Virginia\nGraduate-level TA: Introduction to GIS (Fall 2025)\nUndergraduate-level TA: Introduction to GIS (Fall 2025), Conservation Ecology (Spring 2026)\nVassar College\nUndergraduate-level course TA: Introduction to Environmental Science Field Lab (Fall 2023, 2024)"

    "text": "Roll tide!!!!! This past weekend, September 26th to 28th, myself (Ethan) and Meghan embarked on a trip down to Paint Rock Forest, ~20 miles southwest of Hunstville, AL, for some field work! I was scouting for some more tupelo for my research, and Meghan came along to help out and also check out one of the newest ForestGEO sites, Paint Rock Forest!\nHaving never navigated karst topography before, and having never been to Alabama, I was in for some new experiences. The forest there was probably the healthiest forest I have ever been in. So much species diversity! The native Euonymus! The native Callicarpa! Flowering orchids! Wowowowowow!!!!\nWe had the absolute pleasure of being helped out and shown around by Helen and Patience, both field workers at Paint Rock and who know the site like the back of their hands. It’s so amazing to hear about and walk around a site from those who are so passionate about it. I learned lots about the natural environment in Paint Rock as well as the various research projects going on there (cave ecology!!!!). Also, Helen took us around on the UTV which saved us a lottttt of bushwhacking and scrambling!\nOur fieldwork was pretty successful, with many a tupelo found, though notably looking a bit less healthy compared to their northern counterparts. This could be because we’re pushing the southern end of their range here, and they are moving northward, but it was an interesting observation nonetheless.\nNow, on to fruit cleaning!\nResearch aside, here’s a list of cool things we saw/ did:\n\nWent around on a UTV\nSaw a southern devil scorpion (Vaejovis carolinianus)\nCaves!!! so many caves!!!
